# NewRetrograde

## Version 1.1.0

A retrograde plugin for MuseScore 3.x.

Basic Instructions:
Make a selection of notes, chords, and/or rests, on a single staff with a single voice, then run NewRetrograde to reverse the selection.

Tested on MuseScore 3.x in macOS and Windows 10 and it seems to work okay.

### Changelog

**1.1.0**

- MIDI note pitches now also include TPC data for proper accidentals
- Removed single-note code as the chord code can handle single notes

**1.0.1**

- Added functionality to include rests in retrograde selection
